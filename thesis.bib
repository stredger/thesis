@article{Bian2009,
abstract = {Ubiquitous connectivity and availability of P2P resources creates opportunities for building new services. This paper describes Jigsaw Distributed File System (JigDFS) which can be used to securely store and retrieve files on a P2P network anonymously. JigDFS is designed to provide strong encryption and a certain level of plausible deniability. Files in JigDFS are sliced into small segments using an information dispersal algorithm (IDA) and distributed onto different nodes recursively to increase fault tolerance against node failures. Moreover, layered encryption is applied to each file with keys produced by a hashed-key chain algorithm, so that data (file segments) and keys reside on different hosts. In such a scheme, if an attacker compromises a host and retrieves the data, the attacker will still need the correct key to decipher the data. Furthermore, recursive IDA and layered encryption ensure users' anonymity. It is difficult for an adversary to identify who owns a file, even who has retrieved a file in JigDFS. Often, a strong adversary may have the power to monitor the network or even force a user to give up the password. Design of JigDFS provides users with plausible deniability which enhances privacy. When being questioned, a JigDFS user can simply argue that he/she is merely a relaying node, rather than the file owner. Moreover, a user, when forced, can give up a valid, however, incorrect encryption key. There is no way for an adversary to verify either correctness of a key or the identity of file owner. JigDFS is developed using platform independent Java technologies and is envisioned to utilize mobile computing elements such as PDAs and smart phones.},

@article{Ghemawat2003,
abstract = {We have designed and implemented the Google File System, a scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients. While sharing many of the same goals as previous distributed file systems, our design has been driven by observations of our application workloads and technological environment, both current and anticipated, that reflect a marked departure from some earlier file system assumptions. This has led us to reexamine traditional choices and explore radically different design points. The file system has successfully met our storage needs. It is widely deployed within Google as the storage platform for the generation and processing of data used by our service as well as research and development efforts that require large data sets. The largest cluster to date provides hundreds of terabytes of storage across thousands of disks on over a thousand machines, and it is concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In this paper, we present file system interface extensions designed to support distributed applications, discuss many aspects of our design, and report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and real world use.},
